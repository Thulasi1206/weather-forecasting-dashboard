<h1>Weather Forecasting Dashboard</h1>
Project Overview
The Weather Forecasting Dashboard is a simple, static web application that displays current weather and a 5-day forecast in a clean and accessible layout. Built purely with HTML, this dashboard showcases essential weather information and provides an easy way for users to visualize forecast data.

Features
Current Weather
Displays current temperature with an icon representing the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
Shows the current location set as India.
5-Day Forecast
Lists weather predictions for the next five days.
Provides a table with each day’s weather icon and temperature for quick reference.
How It Works
This static dashboard uses pre-defined data to represent current weather and a 5-day forecast. It’s designed to serve as a template or prototype for a future, dynamic weather app. The layout is simple, with intuitive icons and a responsive format, making it an ideal project for HTML learning and resume building.

How to Use
View Current Weather: Shows temperature and weather conditions for the current location.
View 5-Day Forecast: Displays forecasted weather and temperatures in a straightforward table format.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the content and layout.
CSS: (Optional) Could be added for styling enhancements.
Future Enhancements
Integrate live weather data from an API to make the dashboard dynamic.
