<h1>Weather Forecasting Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Weather Forecasting Dashboard is a simple, static web application that displays current weather and a 5-day forecast in a clean and accessible layout. Built purely with HTML, this dashboard showcases essential weather information and provides an easy way for users to visualize forecast data.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Current Weather</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Displays current temperature with an icon representing the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy).</li>
    <li>Shows the current location set as India.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5-Day Forecast</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lists weather predictions for the next five days.</li>
    <li>Provides a table with each day’s weather icon and temperature for quick reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>This static dashboard uses pre-defined data to represent current weather and a 5-day forecast. It’s designed to serve as a template or prototype for a future, dynamic weather app. The layout is simple, with intuitive icons and a responsive format, making it an ideal project for HTML learning and resume building.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>View Current Weather:</strong> Shows temperature and weather conditions for the current location.</li>
    <li><strong>View 5-Day Forecast:</strong> Displays forecasted weather and temperatures in a straightforward table format.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Used to structure the content and layout.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS:</strong> (Optional) Could be added for styling enhancements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integrate live weather data from an API to make the dashboard dynamic.</li>
    <li>Add more weather details, such as humidity or wind speed.</li>
    <li>Enhance the design with CSS for improved user experience.</li>
</ul>
